# Tag Registration

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deploying tags without registration is futile – always ensure tags are registered to your Motus project prior to deployment.
{% endhint %}

All tags used with Motus must first be registered before any data can be acquired from Motus stations.

## Automatic Registrations

With some exceptions, all tags purchased from Lotek or CTT are registered automatically to a Motus project upon shipment. This means you must provide the tag manufacturer with your Motus project ID when ordering your tags.

1. [Register](https://motus.org/data/user/new) with Motus
2. Create or join a project
3. Provide CTT with your project ID when purchasing tags.

## Manual Registrations

In some specific instances, it may be necessary for you to register your tags manually. _Please only do this if you have been instructed by Motus._

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please do not register tags more than once. If you need tags transferred between projects [contact us](https://motus.org/contact/).
{% endhint %}

1. [Register](https://motus.org/data/user/new) with Motus
2. [Register your tags](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/VHF\_Tag\_Registration): Instructions on registering tags can be found [here](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/VHF\_Tag\_Registration). To register a tag, you need to make a short recording of its output using a [funcubedongle](http://www.funcubedongle.com) attached to a PC. Tag Registration Kits can be purchased from Motus. Each kit includes a funcube, whip antenna, and tag activator. We strongly encourage you to test and register all tags immediately after receiving them to ensure they’re ready for deployment. **Always check your Manage Tags page after registration to ensure they have all been uploaded correctly.**
3. [Upload tag registrations](https://motus.org/data/project/sgJobs): Send us your completed tag registrations from step 2 [here](https://motus.org/data/project/sgJobs) using your Motus login information.

## Tag Fees

Your project will be invoiced based on the number of tags registered following the [Motus Collaboration Policy and Fee Schedule](https://motus.org/policy/).
