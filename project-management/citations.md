# Citations

## When to cite projects

You must cite any project which deployed transmitters that you are using in your research.&#x20;

* **Example 1:** for your Master's thesis, you deployed 120 transmitters on animals. You are only using data from these transmitters in your analysis so you only need to include your own project in your citations.
* **Example 2:** you are conducting a network-wide analysis of all Swainson's Thrushes deployed across Motus. You are using data from multiple projects which have deployed transmitters so you must include each project as a separeate citation.

## Citation **Format**

Citations can be formatted based on institutions or collaborators listed in the project. By default, the format will be based on the project's institutions, but if none are listed it will be based on the projects collaborators.

* To edit your project's institutions, see [**Institutions**](institutions.md)****
* To edit your project's collaborators, see [**Collaborators**](collaborators.md)****
* To edit your project's citation format, go to [**Manage Collaborators, Institutions, and Citations**](https://motus.org/data/project/users) **** and scroll to the bottom of the page.&#x20;
