# Tag Deployment

Motus supports two types of uniquely coded radio transmitters: NanoTags™ manufactured by [Lotek Wireless Inc](http://lotek.com), operating on frequencies 166.380 MHz (Western Hemisphere), 150.100 MHz (Europe), and 151.500 MHz (Australia), and LifeTag™ and PowerTags™ manufactured by [Cellular Tracking Technologies](http://www.celltracktech.com) (CTT) operating on 434 MHz globally. The two tags use fundamentally different transmission and coding systems.

Tags range in size from \~0.2 g to \~2.6 g, and lifespans vary from 20 days to infinity, depending on the model. It is important to check the [Motus Receiver Map](https://motus.org/data/receiversMap) to confirm which frequency other stations/antennas are operating on throughout the network. When communicating with Lotek or CTT, be sure to explicitly state that you want your tags/system to be compatible with Motus. Be sure to review our [Motus Tag Guide](broken-reference) in detail. Please [contact Motus](https://motus.org/contact), or the tag providers above for more information.

## Steps

1. ****[**Register a Motus user.**](https://motus.org/data/user/new) **** Collaborators wishing to deploy tags must first register with Motus.
2. ****[**Join or create a project**](../../project-management/introduction.md)**.** In order for tags to be detected using the Motus network, they must be registered to a Motus project. ****&#x20;
3. ****[**Purchase tags**](../../tags/tag-selection.md#purchasing-tags)**.** If purchasing CTT tags, make sure you provide the tag manufacturer with your Motus project ID. Not sure which tags to get?[ Review our chapter on tag selection.](../../tags/tag-selection.md)
4. ****[**Register tags**](../../tags/tag-registration.md)**.** Or if using CTT tags, make sure they are registered to your project.
5. ****[**Deploy tags.** ](../../tags/tag-deployment.md)Several techniques exist to deploy Motus tags and more are being developed and tested. This document provides instructions for affixing tags to a variety of species. If your group uses different methods, or have any additional information, please [contact Motus](https://motus.org/contact)

Tags **MUST** be registered with Motus prior to deployment!
